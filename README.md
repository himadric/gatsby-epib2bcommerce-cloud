# Episerver B2B Commerce Cloud JAMStack implementation

## Introduction
[JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/), it is like walking back to the web development technology, except this is for good reason. In 90s web development, we were all excited when web servers started processing web request programetically and rendered html. Server side programming although provided much flexibility is not as fast as static html. Now armed with much better client side technolgy and build tools, JAMStack architecture bringing back incredibly fast static page rendering.

In this project I built an Episerve B2B Commerce Cloud Storefront using JAMStack archtecture. I built the website using GatsbyJs and deployed in [Surge](https://surge.sh/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
